   Hey,

   I'm going to be in NY at the end of the month, was thinking of dropping
   by...any thoughts?

   d

That would be wonderful!  The kids will be out of school by the end of
next week, and we have no plans, except that there's a Girl Scout
overnight trip (at a local zoo!) on Saturday the 24th, for which we are
all committed, as Jan is the leader.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong on
the date, Jan.)
